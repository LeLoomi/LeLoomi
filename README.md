### Professional penguin employed at Southpole Inc., Antarctica.
Enrolled for a Diploma in Information Systems Engineering over at [Technical University of Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de), but I won't be done for a loooong time.
My activity on GitHub highly fluctuates since I don't have many ideas on what to code :/
